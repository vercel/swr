## The Idea behind the Example

This examples show how to combine Next.js getServerSideProps with the SWR `fallbackData` option to support Server-Side Rendering.

The application will fetch the data server-side and then receive it as props, that data will be passed as `fallbackData` to SWR, once the application starts client-side SWR will revalidate it against the API and update the DOM, if it's required, with the new data.
