// This benchmark demonstrates the performance overhead of the `useSWR()` call.
// It renders 1000 components which contain the SWR hook of 50 unique keys,
// that is a reasonable estimation of the usage in a normal sized web app.
//
// However it doesn't include benchmarks for other parts of the lib, as we are
// mainly focused on the FMP metrics and that's the most noticable thing.
// Revalidations and subsequent re-renders will happen quietly when idle.
//
// To run this benchmark, install `react-benchmark` globally and execute:
//
//   react-benchmark test/benchmark.js
//
