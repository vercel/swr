When writing or editing documentation content, follow Vercel's style guide:

### Voice and Tone

- **Write plainly and concisely** - readers want answers, not muddled language
- **Use active voice** - "You created an account" not "The account was created"
- **Write in second person** - use "you" instead of "I", "we", "us"
- **Be conversational but not jokey** - guide like a friend, avoid jokes in technical content
- **Use positive language** - avoid "can't" and "don't", focus on what users can accomplish

### Writing Guidelines

- **Get to the point fast** - front-load crucial information
- **Use fewer words** - shorter is almost always better
- **Avoid filler words** - eliminate "very", "easy", "quick", "simple"
- **Use gender-neutral terms** - "they" as singular, "developers" not "guys"
- **American English** - use American spelling and conventions

### Technical Content Rules

- **Describe data sizes**: "64 KB" (space + capitalized abbreviation)
- **Placeholder values**: Use descriptive snake_case for text (`your_api_key_here`), count 1-9 for numbers
- **Instruction headings**: Name after the goal ("Configure a Build", not "Configuration")
- **Money discussions**: Be explicit and clear, use tables for pricing
- **Capitalization**: When in doubt, don't capitalize (sentence-style)

### Code and Examples

- Use descriptive placeholder values in code samples
- Make placeholders easy to select (snake_case for text)
- Provide complete, working examples when possible
- Test code examples to ensure they work
